This repository contains code and analysis for a manuscript that uses acoustic data to examine how vocal activity patterns vary between dawn and dusk for a tropical bird community and what are its ecological and phylogenetic determinants.  

This manuscript is currently in _progress_. Please reach out to the lead author if you have questions.

A readable version of this analysis is available in bookdown format by clicking on the heading above.  

### Source code for the analyses

We describe what each script (`.Rmd`) of this repository is intended to achieve below.  

This project builds on data that was collected for a previously published manuscript in [Biological Conservation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320723001726). Please refer to this [link](https://vjjan91.github.io/acoustics-Restoration/) to view code and analysis for the previously published manuscript. The outputs from the previously written analyses are now added to the `data/` folder.   


** Work in progress **
We will carry out the following here:

-dawn and dusk detections (cumulative)  
-dawn and dusk vocal activity (how is vocal activity measured and estimated?; also run separate analysis on proportions?)  
-dawn and dusk species richness (jacknife?)(not necessarily needed)  
-PGLS analysis/no PGLS analysis?   
    dawn  
    dusk  
  (including habitat structure ~ PC measurements, habitat affiliation (RF/OC), foraging guild, trophic niche/diet, and )

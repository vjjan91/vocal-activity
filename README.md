This repository contains code and analysis for a manuscript that uses acoustic data to examine how vocal activity patterns vary between dawn and dusk for a tropical bird community and what are its ecological and phylogenetic determinants.  

This manuscript is currently in _progress_. Please reach out to the lead author if you have questions.
